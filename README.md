# Single-image-super-res
The purpose of this project was to explore image super resolution using deep learning, convolutional neural networks and residual learning to help propagate the information further 

I achieved performance comparable to Single image super resolution using SRCNN on a much shallower network through the use of residual information thats passed through the netowrks.
The PSNR score of 30.66dB which outperformed the SRCNN model which achieved 30.4dB
